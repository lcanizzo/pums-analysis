-- "A lot of features are thus typically
gathered for a specific problem while many of them
can be either redundant or irrelevant. These useless
features often tend to decrease the performances of
the learning (classification or regression) algorithms
(Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003) and slower the whole
learning process. Moreover, reducing the number of
attributes leads to a better interpretability of the problem and of the models, which is of crucial importance
in many industrial and medical applications. Feature
selection thus plays a major role both from a learning
and from an application point of view"
